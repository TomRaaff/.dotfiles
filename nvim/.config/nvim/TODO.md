# To do

## To fix

- [X] `<leader>sw` doesn't work properly. It doesn't show the results it should
- [X] autoclose neotree after opening a file with it.
- maybe move to lazyvim?
- [X] code completion doesn't work nicely. I can't esc insert mode while its visible.
- Check out mini.nvim plugin. It contains 'mini.surround' for surrounding text.
- figure out how to resize split windows
- [X] Fix the TS imports

## To learn

- Set up tmux so I can mostly use an extra terminal for:
  - zsh git aliases
  - running npm scripts etc.
